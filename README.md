In todayâ€™s session, we dived deeper into C programming fundamentals that play a crucial role in building logical and interactive programs.

ðŸ”‘ Key Topics Covered:

Switch Statement â€“ Perfect for handling multiple fixed choices (e.g., menus, grading systems). Learned how case, break, and default work together to manage program flow.

Loops â€“ Essential for repeating tasks efficiently:

while â†’ Condition checked first, then executes.

do-while â†’ Executes at least once before condition check.

for â†’ Combines initialization, condition, and update in one line.

ðŸ’¡ These concepts are the backbone of structured programming and are widely used in logic-based tasks within cybersecurity and software development.
